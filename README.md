# PowerQuery-Project


This project is for AtliQ hardware who sells products across globe. They sell products to the distributers, retails and online. We analyzed 3 years sales data and came up with Customer and Market Performance Report where we shown all the sales numbers and profit/loss percentage.

First we perform ETL to clean the data, add columns, change data types etc and load back it to excel (Only one connection).

After that added to data model under power pivot. Performed data modelling by connecting tables with each other. With the help of power pivot created tables where we showcase yearly data of each Customer (Platforms) and markets (Countries).
